Simple Game of Life app coded in Dart.

The intent was to try a language I didn't know (Dart) and see if I can write code that reads well.

Learnings:
- KISS.
- stick to concepts that exist in the domain when naming methods/vars.
- read those fancy method names an hour after you've written them; chances are, you won't find them very readable.
- identify and segregate responsibilities for objects.
- avoid transitive dependencies.
